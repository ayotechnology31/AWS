Module 9 introduction

Learning objectives
In this module, you will learn how to:

- Understand migration and innovation in the AWS Cloud.
- Summarize the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF). 
- Summarize the six key factors of a cloud migration strategy.
- Describe the benefits of AWS data migration solutions, such as AWS Snowcone, AWS Snowball, and AWS Snowmobile.
- Summarize the broad scope of innovative solutions that AWS offers.



So looks like we've established how to get going on the AWS Cloud, but what if you have existing deployments in on-premises environments or have started a cloud journey without AWS? Well, we'd love to help you move across, especially since you can take advantage of some real savings by moving. 

This brings us to migration and innovation. We'll show you all the options from migration tools, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework, and even the Snow Family, which are physical devices to migrate data in and out of AWS. 

So before we adjourn, stay glued to your seats for information on how to move from on-premises environment or the cloud to AWS. We'll even cover the six Rs of migration.
