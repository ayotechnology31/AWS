Module 8 summary

In Module 8, you learned about the following concepts:

Three types of offers included in the AWS Free Tier: 12 months free, Always free, and Trials
- Benefits of consolidated billing in AWS Organizations
- Tools for planning, estimating, and reviewing AWS costs
- Differences between the four AWS Support plans: Basic, Developer, Business, and Enterprise
- How to discover software in AWS Marketplace


Well, you've heard a lot about pricing and support, and it's probably a lot more than you initially thought. You learned about the pay-as-you-go nature of using AWS cloud resources. We discussed the difference between on-premises and cloud costs, and we even showed you how you can get your feet wet with the free tier offered with most AWS services. 

We talked about how AWS Organizations can be used and how it can help you with consolidated billing of multiple AWS accounts. We covered AWS Budgets, Cost Explorer. We even explored AWS Console billing, so you could get familiar with it, and then switched gears to talk about the different support models offered on AWS. Very handy if you're looking for assistance on your cloud journey. 

Speaking of assistance, we introduced you to the expansive AWS partner ecosystem so you can find partners to help you with your workloads. And lastly, we touched upon AWS Marketplace if you're looking for click-and-go services.
