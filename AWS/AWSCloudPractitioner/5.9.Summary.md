Module 5 summary
In Module 5, you learned about the following concepts:

- Amazon EC2 instance store and Amazon EBS
- Amazon S3
- Amazon EFS
- Relational databases and Amazon RDS
- Nonrelational databases and DynamoDB
- Amazon Redshift
- AWS DMS
- Additional database services and accelerators


Another module completed. Awesome stuff. You learned about all the different types of AWS storage mechanisms. Let's recap them, shall we? 

The first one we learned about is Elastic Block Store volumes, and you attach those to EC2 instances so you have local storage that is not ephemeral. 

You learned about how S3 and how you can store objects in AWS with the click of a button or call of an API. 

We even discussed the various relational database options available on AWS. Or for the workloads that just need a key-value pair, we have the non-relational offering called DynamoDB. 

Next up was EFS for file storage use cases. 

We then have Amazon Redshift for all our data warehouse needs. 

And to aid in migration of existing databases, we have DMS or Database Migration Service. 

We also touched upon the lesser known storage services, like DocumentDB, Neptune, QLDB, and Amazon Managed Blockchain. 

Lastly, we talked about how caching solutions like ElastiCache and DynamoDB Accelerator can be used. 

That's a lot of places to store different types of data, and hopefully you've learned the correct place to store each type.
