Looks like we're getting deeper into our AWS account. Things are running well. And I want to let you in on the security measures we have in place. By this, I mean, we have to describe the various security mechanisms we offer on the AWS Cloud, like the shared responsibility model. 

With the shared responsibility model, AWS controls security of the cloud and customers control security in the cloud. We, as AWS, control the data centers, security of our services, and all the layers in this section. The next part are the workloads that AWS customers run in the cloud and those are the customer's responsibility to secure. It's something we share with customers to ensure security in the cloud. 

Let's take a look at the various other security services, mechanisms, and features that AWS has to offer in this module. Stay tuned.
